# Portfolio ✨

A personal portfolio built with React, showcasing my projects, experience, and skills. This site features a responsive design, smooth animations, and modern web development techniques for an engaging user experience.

**Styling inspired by [truethari/reactfolio](https://github.com/truethari/reactfolio).** Kudos to him! 👏

## Features 🚀

- Fully responsive layout for all devices (phones, tablets, desktops - you name it!)
- Smooth animated page transitions (because life's too short for jarring changes).
- Dark/light theme toggle (for those late-night coding sessions or bright sunny days).
- Project showcase with links to live demos and code.
- Clean, modern UI that's easy on the eyes and a joy to navigate.

## What's Cookin' Next? 🍳 (Future Ideas)

- An interactive blog section to share my thoughts and discoveries? ✍️
- Even more delightful animations? (Is there such a thing as _too many_? 🤔)
- Got a brilliant idea? Let me know!
